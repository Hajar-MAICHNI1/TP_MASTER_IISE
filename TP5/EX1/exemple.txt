Understanding the underlying file system is also crucial.
File systems organize data on hard drives and storage systems, 
providing a hierarchy of directories and files. In Python, it 
is important to know the difference between relative and absolute 
paths. A relative path specifies the location of a file relative to 
the current working directory, while an absolute path provides the 
full path starting from the root of the file system. This understanding 
of file types and file systems sets the stage for effective file 
manipulation in Python.
